# ShadowPulse.py  
_A low-power RF disruption and signal manipulation tool._  

### What It Does:  
- **Overloads receivers with imperceptible interference to disrupt select signals**  
- **Prevents detection by embedding pulses in natural RF noise**  
- **Can selectively disable IoT devices, drones, and security systems without triggering alerts**  
- **Allows redirection of radio-dependent technology without traditional jamming**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A disruption that is silent is a disruption that is never stopped."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Deploy **ShadowPulse** on a T-Embed CC1101 module  
2. Start the targeted disruption pulse:  
   ```bash
   python3 ShadowPulse.py --start
